### Creating compelling data stories with animation: A use case of how economic wellbeing affects child mortality rate in Nigeria

Communicating the results of a data science project is an important step in the data science workflow. One proven strategy for effective communication is visualization and storytelling. 

In order to create compelling visuals, we employ some visual qualities, formally known as preattentive attributes, which makes an element in a visual distinct from its neighbours, thereby drawing our attention to it unconsciously. It is a tactic that ensures that the audience pay attention to where we want them to in a visual, thereby passing our message across as quickly and effectively as possible.

In this project, I used a powerful attribute, motion, to create a transitional animation for the reader to make a quick grasp of how changes in economic wellbeing affects under-five mortality in Nigeria, beginning with the state of the economy from the early ’60s when the oil boom began right to the year 2018. As a result of the findings, I also made some practical recommendations on how child health status can be improved in Nigeria. 

This was carried out in a manner that ensures the reader does not spend more than five minutes going through the whole data story. It is worthy of mention that another attribute, colour, was also used as a preattentive attribute but this was made to play a secondary role.

The attribute of motion, when used correctly and appropriately, helps an audience to quickly make sense of a visualization, especially one that would be more difficult to understand when presented in a static form.
